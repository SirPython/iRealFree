            Sorry for the bad interface; this is still in very early stages of development. Right now, all you can do is punch in the leadsheet in plaintext below, and hit enter to have it play.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not a very practical application yet. For example, there's no way to save charts. Please standby while more features are added.
        </p>
        <form>
            <input type="text" name="leadsheet">
            <input type="button" name="submit" value="Start">
        </form>
        <p>
            For entering leadsheets, a very specialized syntax is used. In the future, this will be replaced by a friendly UI that will allow for easier entering.

            Here is an example of a simple 12-bar blues in this special syntax:
        </p>
        <code>
            Blues,SirPython,swing,240,4/4,1:C7|F7|C7|C7|F7|F#o7|C7|A7|D-7|G7|C7,,A7|D-7,,G7
        </code>
